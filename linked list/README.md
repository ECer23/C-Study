# Linked list

I've shared some examples of linked list here. They're all written by myself so it's hard to avoid errors. But I've tried my best to test them.  
They're both for C++ and you can compile & run the source files.  
Or use Visual Stdio to run the program.  
Details of the class are all commented in the source file. If you can't understand some of them, please contact me.
